# IntersectionObserver
A modern visual application using the IntersectionObserver API with plain JavaScript.
## Features
- Modern use of the IntersectionObserver API: Efficiently detects element visibility.
- Clean and minimalist interface: Dark layout with clear visual feedback (rotating arrow and header).
- Responsive and stylish design: Uses Font Awesome for icons and pure CSS for styling.
- No heavy dependencies: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## How It Works
1. The fixed arrow in the footer rotates when the `.visible` content appears in the viewport.
2. A header (`.header`) automatically appears at the top of the page when the content comes into focus.
3. All of this is controlled using `IntersectionObserver`, without relying on manual scroll events.
## How to use
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/xXanDEVx/IntersectionObserver.git
```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
